# KD-Tree and Quad-Tree Implementations

This repository contains Python implementations of two popular data structures used for organizing points in a k-dimensional space: KD-Tree and Quad-Tree.

## Overview

The KD-Tree and Quad-Tree are efficient data structures for various applications including spatial searching, nearest neighbor queries, range searches, and more. This project aims to provide basic and understandable implementations of these trees.

## Features

- **KD-Tree Implementation**: Efficient for organizing points in any k-dimensional space.
- **Quad-Tree Implementation**: Specifically designed for two-dimensional space management.

## Getting Started

To use the implementations in your projects, clone the repository and include the files in your Python environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikosBakalis/K-D_Tree-Quad_Tree.git
